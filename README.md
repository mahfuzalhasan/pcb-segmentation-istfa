# pcb-image-segmentation
## Dataset
>Will provide the modified split for the subset of [FPIC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08414) soon.
## Framework
PyTorch 1.11.0
## Language
Python 3.7.12
## Task
Segmentation
## Testing Dataloader
1. We are going to provide the image ids for the subset of [FPIC dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08414) that we have used soon. This will be the filtered version of the FPIC Dataset. In addition to that we are also going to provide train, validation and test split. <br />
2. With the split, run **python3 train.py**.<br />
3. To test, set *test_model_path* in the configuration.py file. Then run **python3 test.py**
